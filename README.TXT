Project: lab-classes
Authors: David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling

This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition
   David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling
   Pearson Education

It is discussed in chapter 1.

The purpose of this project is to illustrate object interaction and to examine
some simple code. See chapters one and three of the book.

To use this project, create some Student objects, then create a LabClass object.
Add the students to the class using the "enrolStudent" method. Print a class
list.

Answers to questions:
Calling the getName method shows the string name of the student I clicked on.

Calling the numberOfStudents method shows the number of students who are currently enroled in the LabClass.

0 (int)
“hello” (string)
101 (int)
-1 (int)
true (Boolean)
“33” (string)
3.1415 (It could be a double or float)

I wasn't able to answer questions 32, 33 and 34, as I did not know what to do in each of those questions.

The book I am reading is an object, and its class is book.

No, objects can only belong to a single class.
